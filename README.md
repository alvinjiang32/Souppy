# Souppy
My journey of Python using BeautifulSoup and whatever else may come along. To be updated.

Project 1 was an initial intro to python, bs4, and other libraries. In hindsight, getting the top 20 most active stocks doesn't provide a consistent set of companies. Thus, I will gather data over time and then probably create a graph on which ones were traded and how much it rose, and if there were any factors that could have affected it.
Project 2 is still a tbd, there is no clear path yet, I have to explore pandas and tensorflow to see which one I would enjoy more. There may be other ones, but tensorflow and pandas are the main ones.
